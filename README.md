# Bizy
A business card makeover. Semester long project for course iOS development (67442) Fall 2018.

Bizy is an iOS application that makes storing and sharing digital business cards flawless.

As the world has fully immersed into a digital age, hard copies have long been left in the past. All information nowadays is stored digitally, but business cards have been an exception. The chance of losing a piece of paper is much greater than losing that same information digitally, and information as valuable as an important point of contact would be frustrating if lost. Business cards are incredibly easy to lose, and that loss might have been a recruiter at your dream company, a long lost friend, or otherwise. 

That is where Bizy comes in. Bizy stores another person’s contact information digitally, so that you never lose an important connection again. Not only does Bizy address the previous pain point, but the quick exchange of contact information allows the conversation between two people to keep flowing, instead of the disruptive method of writing down an email or phone number, even if digitally. 

The most important part of a business card is the information on the card, not the physical card itself. When handling physical cards they can easily be lost and misplaced. Bizy allows users to retain the information by keeping an organized wallet of information by user. This information includes a user’s name, email, profession, number*, resume*, website*, and various other details that an individual would have on their business card. Additionally, an individual may have a limited amount of business cards while on the go or in the office but with Bizy acting as a mobile app it allows a user has an “unlimited amount” of cards. The QR code scan by wallet also makes the interaction of “exchanging” a business card easier.
